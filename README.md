🧩 TCP Server & Client – Python Socket Programming
Simple implementation of a TCP-based client-server communication system using Python's socket library.

This project demonstrates how to:

Build a TCP server that listens for incoming client connections

Create a TCP client that connects to the server

Exchange data (send & receive messages) reliably over the network

Handle basic connection lifecycle (connect, communicate, close)

🔧 Features
Bi-directional communication over TCP

Basic connection handling (single/multi client)

Clean, beginner-friendly code structure

Easily extendable for chat apps, remote control, or IoT projects

🚀 Getting Started
Run server.py to start the server.

Run client.py to connect and send messages.

📚 Requirements
Python 3.x

No external dependencies (uses built-in socket)
